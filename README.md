# ⚙️ Planetary Gear System – CAD Design Project

## 📌 Overview
This project contains the complete 3D CAD model of a **planetary gear system**, developed in SolidWorks. Planetary gear trains are used in applications that require high torque transmission in a compact space, such as automotive gearboxes, robotics, and industrial drives.

This project includes gear modeling and motion simulation of the system under ideal conditions.
